**When words aren't enough, and emojis just don't cut it, gifs come to the rescue!**

Xpression is a web application that displays gifs to users.You do not have to be logged in to explore the appliation but if you do, then you will be able to save your favorites.<br>
Xpression also allows users to search for gifs that fit a certain theme. You could for instance search dancing gifs or happy birthday. <br>
The main aim of this project is to get to work with APIs and to explore the whole Software Development Life Cycle.
